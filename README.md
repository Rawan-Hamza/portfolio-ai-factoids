AI Factoids

AI Factoids is a web application that uses artificial intelligence to generate factoids in real-time. 

How it works
AI Factoids is powered by a davinci-003 (OpenAI) that has been trained on a large dataset of factoids. When you request a fact, the model analyzes the keywords in your request and generates a new fact based on those keywords. The result is a fact that is customized to your request and guaranteed to be fresh and funny.

Getting started
To use AI Factoids, simply visit our website. You will see a form where you can enter your fact request. Type in a keyword or phrase related to the kind of fact you want, and then click the "Teach me" button. AI Factoids will generate a fact based on your request and display it on the screen.

Technical details
AI Factoids is built with a React front-end and a Node.js back-end. The machine learning model is implemented using OpenAI API. The model is hosted on a cloud server and accessed via a REST API.
