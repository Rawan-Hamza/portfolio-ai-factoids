AI Jokes

AI Jokes is a web application that uses artificial intelligence to generate jokes in real-time. With AI Jokes, you can get a fresh, funny joke whenever you need a laugh.

How it works
AI Jokes is powered by a machine learning model (OpenAI) that has been trained on a large dataset of jokes. When you request a joke, the model analyzes the keywords in your request and generates a new joke based on those keywords. The result is a joke that is customized to your request and guaranteed to be fresh and funny.

Technical details
AI Jokes is built with a React front-end and a Node.js back-end. The machine learning model is implemented using Python and TensorFlow. The model is hosted on a cloud server and accessed via a REST API.
